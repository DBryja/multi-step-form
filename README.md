## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JS language extension
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [ReactHookForm](https://react-hook-form.com/) - React Hook

### Continued development

I'm not really glad of the outcome.
There is a lot of place for improvement, as I have added the react-hook-form in the middle of development, my project is not written with this feature in mind, thus this results in combination of two methods - state managment for storing data and updating fields and react-hook-form only for validation, lowering the performence.
I should replace current(state managment) input subscription with "watch" tool, which decreases the amount of components rerendering, what would significantly increase the efficiency.
